I really enjoy both of the universes, but Star Trek is my favorite. When I was a child one of my best memmories was watching Star Trek reruns with my parents, and when Next Generation came out that was the thing I looked forward to every week. For me the attraction was the more technical nature of the show, it felt more realistic, more like an attainable goal for my future. Also, the mystisism of the force felt to much like religion to me, and being raised catholic I had enough of that in my life.
